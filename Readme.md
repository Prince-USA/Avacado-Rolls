# What is an Avacado Roll

Avacado Rolls are a dish that is mainly used as a starter dish and was one of my favorite dishes at P.F.Chang until they remoed it. The recipe that I am 
using is also usable for vegitarians and has some extra sauce to make it taste better.Please try it and give me feedback on how it tastes and looks. ;)
