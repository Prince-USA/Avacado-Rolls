"INSTRUCTIONS
Prepare the cilantro ranch by combining all of the ingredients in a food processor or blender (start with 1 tbsp of milk and 1 tbsp of vinegar). Pulse 
until combined. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Place in the fridge until ready to use.

Add the avocado to a bowl and mash until the desired consistency is reached. Add the tomato, onion, cilantro, cumin, pepper, salt and lime juice to the 
bowl and stir to combine. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.

Heat an inch of oil to 375 degrees in a dutch oven or large pot.
Fill a small bowl with water. Place your egg roll wrapper on a clean surface and place 3 tbsp of the avocado filling in the center of the wrapper.

Use your finger to dab water onto the 4 corners of the roll. With the wrapper facing you as a diamond shape, fold in the 2 sides. Bring the bottom corner
up, then roll toward the top corner – keeping the roll tight as you roll. Make sure that the exposed corner is secure, adding additional water to that 
corner if needed. Set aside until all of the egg rolls are done.

Working in batches, place your egg rolls in the hot oil. Cook until browned on both sides (approx. 2-4 minutes), flipping as needed. Place finished egg 
rolls on a paper towel lined plate to allow excess oil to drain.

Cut egg rolls in half and serve with the cilantro ranch."
